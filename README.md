# pla-util
A powerline adapter utility

## Overview
The purpose of this program is to allow users to manage DHP-700AV powerline adapters from x86-64 Linux.
Two of these adapters are included in the DHP-701AV PowerLine AV2 2000 Gigabit Starter Kit.
DHP-700AV adapters use the Broadcom BCM60500 chip.

### Supported Powerline Adapters
This program may work with other powerline adapters that comply with the HomePlug AV2 specification and are based on Broadcom chips. The following powerline adapters are supported:

* D-Link DHP-700AV
* Tenda PH3
* Netgear PLP1000 (uses BCM60333)

## Development Environment
This program is being developed using:

* [openSUSE Leap 15.1](https://www.opensuse.org/)
* [GNAT Community Edition 2019](https://www.adacore.com/download), which includes the GNAT Programming Studio IDE
* Git 2.16.4

## How to Build the Program with GNAT Programming Studio (GPS)
1. Use git to clone this repository.
2. Launch GPS, select **Open existing project**, and browse to the `pla_util.gpr` project file.
3. Use GPS's **Build All** toolbar button to build the project, or try **Build** > **Project** > **Build All**.

If the build is successful, the `pla-util` executable will be in the same directory as the `pla_util.gpr` project file.

## How to Grant the Program Permission to use Packet Sockets
Before you can use the program, you will need to grant the program
permission to use packet sockets. Otherwise, you may see the
following error messages when you run the program:

```
Execution terminated by unhandled exception
raised ETHERNET.DATAGRAM_SOCKET.SOCKET_ERROR : Operation not permitted
```

To grant permission, you can use the following command:

```
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep pla-util
```

## How to Run the Program
To run the program, use one of the following commands:

```
./pla-util <nic> discover
./pla-util <nic> reset <pla-mac-address>
./pla-util <nic> restart <pla-mac-address>
./pla-util <nic> get-hfid manufacturer
./pla-util <nic> get-hfid user
./pla-util <nic> get-network-info member
./pla-util <nic> get-network-info any
./pla-util <nic> set-hfid <id>
./pla-util <nic> set-nmk <pass-phrase>
./pla-util <nic> check-dak <plc-pass-phrase>
./pla-util <nic> check-nmk <pass-phrase>
```

where
`<nic>` is the name of an ethernet network device (e.g., `eth0` or `enp0s25`)
connected to a powerline adapter.
`<pla-mac-address>` is the MAC address of a powerline adapter as reported by the `discover` command.
